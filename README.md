# The Adventures of Pierre

## IMPORTANT
This was the very first game that my friend and I created in 2011. So please don't think I wrote this recently. 

The reason for uploading this project was for myself to review and identify how I could better improve the codebase of the game. Obviously, there are a number of things wrong. 

This game was written in Java and before either of us knew how to properly utilise OOP.

I will eventually clean up the code and hopefully make it into a runnable .jar file.
